            <h4>preparation</h4>
            <li>Mix all the dry components (flour, salt, sugar, yeast) together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>This recipe uses very little salt, so the dough is ready to bake quite quickly. If you need to space out the dough in time, use more salt for the dough that should take longer to rise.</li>
            <li>Add the water. Mix until combined, i.e. no more loose flour. (Recommended handmixer, hands work too.)</li>
            <li>Add the oil. Mix until combined smoothly, i.e. no more visible shiny oil. <b>Important:</b> mix in the oil as slowly as possible. Especially when using a handmixer this should take at least 2 to 3 minutes. Make sure not to stir around to much and just let the oil slowly absorb into the dough. This will make the dough <i>much</i> more smooth and uniform.</li>
            <li>Now mix for about 10 more minutes by hand. Or continue to use the handmixer, for about 5 minutes. In general the result will just get better the longer you mix, do not overdo it however.</li>
            <li>Split the dough into <span class="portions">2</span> equal portions by weight. Place each in a pre-oiled bowl. Make sure to swirl the dough around in the bowl so it too is oiled from all sides.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let the dough rise, for about 20-45 minutes (depending on room temperature), or until just about doubled in size. <i>It is tempting to let the dough rise more than double, but it will not yield a better result, you can find that out yourself if your try though.</i></p>
        <p>
            <h4>baking</h4>
            For extra brown crust in an oven that does not get very hot, pre-bake each spread out portion with just the sauce and any other hard ingredients for about 3 minutes. Then add the cheese and let bake until gold brown.
            <br>
            If you have an oven that does get very hot then the following are good temperatures to use:
            <br>
            Stone Baked Thin: Top-450째C Bottom-350째C
            <br>
            Pan Pizza Thick: Top-325째C Bottom-325째C <i>(most round pans should hold up at 325 even if they aren't technically made for it, but do not use square pans!)</i>
